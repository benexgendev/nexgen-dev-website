Section 2: The Hook (What’s Broken Today?) — problem out there 
❌ College teaches outdated theory.
❌ YouTube/Udemy = no guidance, no accountability.
❌ Cheap courses = zero career impact.
❌ No one out there to help me out on their career like a young brother 

😡 Result? → Students graduate without projects, without confidence, without jobs.

Section 3: The Solution (Your Unique Angle)
At NexgenDev, we don’t just teach coding. We train you like a real engineer with :
Live weekend classes (practice, not theory).
AI tools & automation (ChatGPT, Copilot, n8n, RAG, voicebots).
Full-stack development (React, Node, Next.js, Databases).
Career readiness (system design, best practices, mock interviews).


Outcome: You graduate with 8+ projects, 1 capstone, a portfolio, and career confidence.

Section 4: The Dopamine Hit (Student Journey Visual)
Imagine this:
Month 1: You build your first Portfolio Website.


Month 3: You launch an Auth-based Notes App with Node.js.


Month 6: You integrate APIs and create your own AI Assistant.


Month 9: You deploy a full-stack E-commerce site on AWS.


Month 12: You showcase a Capstone Project (AI-powered app) in front of recruiters.


Every month → New project → New dopamine rush → New confidence unlocked.
